here the OpenFOAM end time is not provided in controlDict we need to end manually

press ctrl+c to end the simulation

To check the forces use 'forcesplot.txt' and to compare it with the previous simulation "displacement provided in dynamicMeshDict file" use 'forces_output.txt' (use comparisonPlot.m)
